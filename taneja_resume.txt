PROJECTS
Recommendation System for News Stories (Thesis)
(Ongoing)
- Gathering and analyzing article structure of news stories from digital platforms such as Reddit, CNN & FoxNews
- Identifying the attributes that differentiate front page news from other stories; to design a model that can suggest top news stories to imthe editors

Part-of-Speech Tagger
(Spring 2017)
- Implemented a Hidden-Markov model in Python to tag words in a text corpus as Noun, Verb, Preposition etc.
- After initialization the model can improve upon itself by learning from the already tagged words. 

Molecular Conformation Optimization
(Spring 2017)
- Designed a Monte-Carlo sampling method in Python to optimize the placement of atoms in 3-dimensional structure of a molecule.
- The application is scalable to any number of atoms requiring only 3 bytes of storage per atom and has a constant-time complexity per iteration 

Sequence Aligner
(Spring 2017)
- Implemented the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm in Python to align Protein and DNA sequences
- The application can scan through a database of sequences and return the best match possible for a target sequence

Classification of Stacking Fault Energy of Alloys
(Fall 2016)
- Analyzed the effect of chemical composition of Steel alloys on their Stacking Fault Energy (SFE)
- Identified most significant elements affecting SFE of alloys using T-test and Principal Component Analysis
- Trained and benchmarked the classification algorithms (Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines) on the dataset

Automatic Text Classification and Summarization
(Summer 2015)
- Developed a text classifier using machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines)
- Designed a bootstrapping approach to generate summary of news article using their headlines
- Techniques used: stop-words removal, stemming, term frequency-inverse document frequency, additive smoothing

Image Enigma: Encrypt Digital Images
(Spring 2015)
- Implemented the Enigma Machine (a polyalphabetic cipher) in Python and engineered it to encrypt digital images

Person of Interest
(Spring 2015)
- Analyzed Enron dataset in Python using machine learning algorithms to identify persons of interest in the Enron Scandal

VocabList: A cross-platform application
(Spring 2015)
- Developed a cross-platform GUI application using Kivy Framework in Python to maintain a database of words for improving vocabulary


ACTIVITIES
TechSpace (Technical Club at USICT)
(Jan 2014 – May 2016)
- Organized InfoXpression (Annual technical fest) and monthly LAN Gaming Contests
- Presented seminar on “Python Programming Language in Data Science”
